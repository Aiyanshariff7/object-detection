# 🎯 Object Detection with YOLOv3

A Python-based implementation of real-time object detection using the YOLOv3 model and OpenCV. This project demonstrates how to detect and label multiple objects in static images using a pre-trained deep learning model.

## 🧠 Model

- **YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once)**: A fast and accurate deep learning object detection algorithm.
- Pre-trained on the **COCO dataset**, which includes 80 common object categories.

## 🛠️ Features

- Detect multiple objects in an image
- Use of pre-trained YOLOv3 weights for instant results
- Easy to extend to video streams or webcam feeds
